    <p class="a-title">Hi, Iâ€™m Sam.
    <br>
    <br>Dungeon master with a coding problem. Curently listening to Mood by 24kGoldn on repeat. I build things with love, belligerence and React.js. I am a junior wed developer at TownSquare, an excelent Creative agency out of Saint Kilda. Lovely people, excelent work. I am facinated and terrified by AI, confused and enamored by blockchain and concerned and perturbed by something else that is probably important. Thank the gods I forgot what it was. If you want to chat code, kobolds or another word that starts with a ka sound i'll drop my email here.
