    <p class="a-title">Hi, I’m Sam!
    <br>
    <br> I create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website navigation and layout to a company's web hosting and security architecture. My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and the main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong learner and love to read, run, and find new bubble tea shops in Melbourne.
